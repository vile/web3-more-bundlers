"""
Minimal viable example of flashbots usage with dynamic fee transactions.
Sends a bundle of two transactions which transfer some ETH into a random account.
Environment Variables:
- ETH_SENDER_KEY: Private key of account which will send the ETH.
- ETH_RECEIVER_KEY: Private key of account which will receive ETH.
- ETH_SIGNER_KEY: Private key of account which will sign the bundle. 
    - This account is only used for reputation on flashbots and should be empty.
- PROVIDER_URL: HTTP JSON-RPC Ethereum provider URL.
